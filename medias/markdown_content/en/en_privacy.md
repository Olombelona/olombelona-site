## 2. macOS and iOS Applications

### Data we collect

Our apps do not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information unless you voluntarily provide it (for example by contacting us via email).

Our apps may collect anonymous, aggregated usage data (crash reports, performance metrics) solely through Apple's built-in analytics framework (App Store Connect Analytics), subject to your device's privacy settings. We have no access to data if you have opted out of sharing analytics with app developers on your device.

### Third-party SDKs

Our apps do not integrate third-party advertising, tracking, or analytics SDKs beyond Apple's native frameworks.
